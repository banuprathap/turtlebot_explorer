# ROS Turtlebot Explorer

Most mobile robot applications require the ability to navigate. While many robots can navigate using maps, and some can map what they can see, few can explore autonomously beyond their immediate surroundings. Our goal is to develop exploration strategies for the complex indoor environments typically found in real office buildings. Our approach is based on the detection of frontiers, regions on the border between open space and unexplored space.

This project is aimed at rescue operation in indoor environments during disasters. This project has several applications in this domain ranging from inspection of nuclear plants or initial inspection of a damaged building during an earthquake where there is little to zero information about the environment. It will be implemented on a Turtlebot simulated in Gazebo.
